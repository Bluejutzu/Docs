The docs are expected to be in compliance with the Code of Conduct too. No pages should have any malicious links or downloads included.

Repetitive violations of these guidelines might get your access to the repositories restricted.

If you feel like a user is violating these guidelines or feel treated unfairly, please refrain from vigilantism
and instead report the issue to a moderator! The best way is joining our [official Discord community](https://vencord.dev/discord)
and opening a modmail ticket.
