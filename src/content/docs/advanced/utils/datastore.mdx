description: How to store data in Vencord

The Datastore is a wrapper around IndexedDB. This can store arbitrarily large data and supports a lot of datatypes (Blob, Map, ...). For a full list, see the [mdn link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#supported_types). *This is actually just idb-keyval, so if you're familiar with that, you're golden!*

:::caution[Be aware]
This should always be preferred over the Settings API if possible, as localstorage has very strict size restrictions and blocks the event loop and make sure your keys are unique (tip: prefix them with ur plugin name) and please clean up no longer needed entries.

## Using DataStore in your projects

First import it from `@api/index` (alias `src/api/DataStore/index`).

### DataStore.set()
The .set() function is used to initially store data. The following paramaters are expected,
```ts
key: string | number | Date | BufferSource
value: any
```
Example:
```ts
DataStore.set("PluginName_KEY", 123456789);
DataStore.set("PluginName_KEY2", [{Value1: "Shiggy", Value2: "ShiggyDances"}]);
```
### DataStore.get()
Now the .get() function is used to retrieve any value saved via the Key. This will return an array with the value. Expected paramaters are,
```ts
key: string | number | Date | BufferSource
```
Example:
```ts
const value1 = DataStore.get("PluginName_KEY")
const value2 = DataStore.get("PluginName_KEY2")
console.log(value1, value2)
// Returns
value1 = 123456789
value2 = [ 
    0: { 
        Value1: "Shiggy", 
        Value2: "ShiggyDances" 
    }] // This cannot be 1 or above as only one object/array/string etc. can be saved.
```
