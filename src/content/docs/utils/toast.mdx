## What are Toasts?
Toasts are used widely across Discord and other Websites/Services. 
There are two options of toasts to use in Vencord. `Toast` and `showToast`. 
The main difference are the options between those two.

:::tip[What does that mean?]
`showToast` still uses `Toast` under the hood, but has easier usage than Toast, however you cannot configure it as much as `Toast`.
Both can be imported from `@webpack/common` (alias `Vencord/src/webpack/common/index`)
:::

### showToast()
The function expects following parameters,
```ts
message: string, type = ToastType.MESSAGE //ToastType.MESSAGE: 0,
options?: ToastOptions 
/* ToastOptions: position?: number; component?: React.ReactNode, duration?: number; */
```
Example:
```ts
showToast("Hello World")
showToast("Task xyz has failed", 2, { duration: 500 })
```
